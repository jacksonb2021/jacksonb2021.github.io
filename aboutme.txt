I am a 20-year-old Computer Science student at the University of Arizona.
I am an avid hiker, skater, and snowboarder.
One of my greatest passions is travelling and getting around big cities via my longboard.
There is nothing better than a weekend camping trip to reconnect with nature
I love taking care of my Green Tree Frogs and the plants in my garden.
